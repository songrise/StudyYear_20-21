3天长时间还是五天短时间

Recent years, there have seen an incresing demand of shifting working schedule to be 3-days with longer working hours. From my perspective, I am in favour of it.

A job with only three days of work will spare more time for vacation. Such a working schedule will let us relax more due to a longer vacation by compressing the work days. 
Unlike traditional works, such a job with a doubled weekend provide us with enough time to travel around. Wouldn't it nice that 
we take the four days to have a lovely trip to the beach or? After such a vacation, we will also be more prepared both mentally and physically for the coming works.

Secondly, jobs with tightly scheduled works may increase the productivity. As for the traditional work, working hours are commonly arranged as from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.,
which means the total time one engaged in working will be less than 8 hours. Needless to say that the time on commuting and preparation for work will take up a large
portion of the work hours. With a longer time on work, a employee could be pay more effort on real works and thus the productivity of the whole company is likly to 
be promoted.

Admittedly, three days of extensive work maybe too burdensome especially for some senior workers. However, this could be ameliorated by elasticly providing both two working style 
for employees. For those whose desire for longer vacation suppress the fear of temporally tightend stress on working, they may opt the 3-days working style.
But for workers with minor or major issues in facing such a heavy workload, a 5-days weekday choice maybe more preferable. To sum up, the point is that the company sholud 
not make any compulsory restriction on a 3-days style, but leave more space for different workers to choose according to their own plan.

To sum up. My stance is that a 3-days working style is appliable. It will spare more time for vacation and also have the potential to increase the workers productivty.
However, companies should make it optional instead of a mandatory task.
