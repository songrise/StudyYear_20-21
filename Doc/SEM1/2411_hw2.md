canonical:$\Pi_{SNAME,CNAME,GRADE}(\sigma_{LEVEL>2\cap STUDENTID =SID\cap COURSEID = CID \cap DNUM = 24}(STUDENT\times COURSETAKING\times COURSE)$  
STEP 1 $\Pi_{SNAME,CNAME,GRADE}(\sigma_{LEVEL>2}(\sigma_{STUDENTID =SID}(\sigma_{COURSEID = CID} (\sigma_ {DNUM = 24}(STUDENT\times COURSETAKING\times COURSE)$

STEP 2 $\Pi_{SNAME,CNAME,GRADE}((\sigma_{STUDENTID =SID}(COURSETAKING\times(\sigma_{COURSEID = CID}(\sigma_{LEVEL>2}(COURSE)\times (\sigma_ {DNUM = 24} (STUDENT)))))))$

Step 3. Here assume that dnum = 24 is less likely to happen compared to level>2, and level>2 is less likely to happen than other two select conditions.   
$\Pi_{SNAME,CNAME,GRADE}(\sigma_{STUDENTID =SID}(\sigma_{COURSEID = CID}(\sigma_ {DNUM = 24} (STUDENT)\times (\sigma_{LEVEL>2}(COURSE))\times COURSETAKING)))$

Step 4:
$\Pi_{SNAME,CNAME,GRADE}(\sigma_ {DNUM = 24} (COURSE)\bowtie_{COURSEID = CID} (\sigma_{LEVEL>2}(COURSETAKING))\bowtie_{STUDENTID =SID} (STUDENT))$

Step 5:
$\Pi_{SNAME,CNAME,GRADE}(\sigma_ {DNUM = 24} (COURSE)\bowtie_{COURSEID = CID} (\sigma_{LEVEL>2}(COURSETAKING))\bowtie_{STUDENTID =SID} (STUDENT))$
